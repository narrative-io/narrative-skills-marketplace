# Harness fallbacks

What to do when `narrative-mcp` is unavailable and when the harness
doesn't expose `AskUserQuestion`.

Never silently degrade. If a tool is unavailable, say so explicitly
in the explanation.

## `narrative-mcp` unavailable

- Ask the user to paste the dataset's schema (column names + types)
  and 10-25 sample rows.
- With that context pasted in, draft the query and apply the syntax
  rules above manually. You cannot validate without the server —
  add a global caveat in the explanation that the query has *not*
  been server-validated and the user should sanity-check before
  running it through the Narrative UI.
- Never silently degrade. If validation was skipped, say so
  explicitly.

## Waiting tools not available

A Narrative agent run has three waiting tools. `job_monitor(job_id)` takes a
job the platform runs and hands back a handle for it;
`wait_for(handles, timeout_seconds)` pauses the run until those jobs finish and
returns what each did, spending no turns while it waits; `sleep(duration_seconds)`
pauses the run for a set time, for work the platform cannot watch.

No other harness has them, and nothing substitutes for the pause itself — only
for the pacing. Check the status yourself, and put the harness's own wait
between checks:

- **Claude Code** — a `Monitor` driving an `until` loop, so the session stays
  free while the operation runs. Use that rather than `bash sleep`.
- **Any harness with a background or scheduled wait** — same shape: re-check on
  an interval, report once the state is terminal.
- **Nothing of the kind** — a foreground `bash sleep` between status calls, as a
  last resort. Some harnesses block it outright, Narrative agent runs among them
  — though there you would have `sleep` instead.

Cadence and the give-up rule are unchanged; they are in the skill body. Say when
you have degraded: "no wait tool here, so I'm checking every 30s" is worth
knowing when a job runs for an hour.

## "AskUserQuestion" not available

If the harness does not expose `AskUserQuestion` as a named tool
(Claude Code does; most others don't), ask the user the same question
in plain prose — **one question per turn**, never batched — and wait
for a reply before continuing. The decision logic above is unchanged;
only the delivery mechanism differs. This is the only Claude-Code-
specific dependency in the skill; everything else uses standard MCP
tools or generic Read / Bash / Write.
