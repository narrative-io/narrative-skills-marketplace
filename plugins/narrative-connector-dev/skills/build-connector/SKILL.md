# Build Connector

> **Status: stub — implementation pending.** Contract only. This is the
> orchestrator that ties the plugin's phases together; the per-phase logic
> lives in the individual skills it sequences.

## Purpose

Drive a connector from an empty idea to a verified prod deployment by
sequencing the plugin's skills against one shared `connector-spec.yaml`.
The orchestrator never does destructive work itself — it runs the
non-destructive steps and **stops at every human gate**, handing control to
the operator for the irreversible ones.

## Sequence

1. **spec** — `/spec-connector` → `/preflight-connector` (go/no-go).
2. **service** — `/scaffold-connector`, `/define-connector-interface`,
   `/add-connector-oauth` (if OAuth), `/implement-partner-client`,
   `/implement-delivery-executor`, `/add-measurement-ingestion` (if
   measurement), `/test-connector`.
3. **infra / registration** — `/scaffold-connector-infra`,
   `/provision-connector-db`, `/register-connector-app`.
4. **frontend** — `/add-connector-listing`, `/add-connector-app-ui`.
5. **deploy / verify** — `/deploy-connector` → `/verify-connector`.

## Inputs / outputs

- **Input/output:** `connector-spec.yaml` — read at every step, written back
  as each phase resolves values. It is the only state passed between skills.

## Human gates (the orchestrator always stops here)

- **terraform applies** — shared ECR, connector infra, KMS/IAM, RDS,
  measurement inbox bucket.
- **narrative-db migrations** — running any migration, in the separate
  narrative-db repo.
- **app registration** — the `bootstrap-app.py` marketplace/SSM/DSM flow.
- **prod promotion** — every prod `terraform apply` and the final
  `/verify-connector` sign-off.

At each gate the orchestrator summarizes what is about to happen and waits
for explicit confirmation before the owning skill proceeds.

## Composition contract

## The `connector-spec.yaml` composition contract

Every skill in `narrative-connector-dev` reads from — and writes back
to — a single machine-readable artifact: **`connector-spec.yaml`**. It
is the shared state that lets the phases compose. `/spec-connector`
authors it, `/preflight-connector` validates and enriches it, and every
downstream skill treats it as the source of truth for slug names, auth,
identifiers, quick settings, and delivery semantics. Nothing is passed
skill-to-skill except this file.

The spec lives next to the connector work, not in this marketplace repo.
The conventional location is
`~/.narrative/projects/<slug>/connector-spec/connector-spec.yaml` (the
same tree `/spec-connector` writes its prose `spec.md` and research notes
into). A skill that can't find it asks for the path; it never guesses
field values.

### Contract rules

- **Read before you write.** Every skill loads the spec first and treats
  its fields as authoritative. If a field a skill needs is missing or
  marked `TODO`, the skill stops and asks — it does not invent slugs,
  app ids, endpoints, rate limits, or Rosetta attribute URIs. (The
  "DO NOT GUESS" rule from `/spec-connector` holds for the whole plugin.)
- **Write back what you learn.** A skill that resolves a value —
  `preflight-connector` pinning `app_id`, `add-connector-oauth`
  confirming the token-endpoint shape — writes it back so later phases
  read the resolved value.
- **Additive, reviewable edits.** Spec edits are proposed to the human
  and applied on approval, same as any other file change.

### Schema

```yaml
# connector-spec.yaml — the composition contract for narrative-connector-dev
schema_version: 1

# ── Identity ────────────────────────────────────────────────
slug: google-dv360            # lowercase, dashes ok. Drives module dirs,
                              # SSM paths, deploy URLs, Docker image names.
package_slug: googledv360     # dashes dropped. Scala package + pg identifiers
                              # + narrative-db dir names.
display_name: "Display & Video 360"   # human-facing listing name
app_id: 47                    # marketplace app id — max(id)+1 over existing
                              # apps. TODO until /preflight-connector pins it.
destination_type: audience    # audience | conversion_api | measurement | combined.
                              # `audience` means any outbound record/membership
                              # delivery — ad audiences, email list members, CRM
                              # contacts, dataset rows. Ad platforms are one
                              # flavor, not the frame.

# ── Auth model ──────────────────────────────────────────────
auth:
  model: oauth2               # oauth2 | static_credentials | jwt | sftp_key | partner_id_header
  # Present only when model: oauth2. Drives /add-connector-oauth.
  oauth:
    authorize_url: "https://.../oauth2/authorize"
    token_url: "https://.../oauth2/token"
    me_url: "https://.../v1/me"          # user/account lookup after exchange
    redirect_uri: "https://app.narrative.io/connectors/<slug>/callback"
    scopes:
      - "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/display-video"
    scope_encoding: text          # text[] | integer[] — pg column type for scopes
    # Which fields the token endpoint returns → decides token-table columns.
    token_response:
      access_token: true
      refresh_token: true
      expires_in: true
  # Which vendor object the profile binds to (advertiser / ad-account / dataset).
  account_binding: advertiser_id

# ── Identifier groups ───────────────────────────────────────
# Each group is an accepted identifier cluster. `attribute` is the
# canonical Rosetta Stone URI; `ref_kind` is the metaschema $ref
# discriminator (attribute_value | attribute_typed_value |
# attribute_context_value | string_value_type). narrative_id is always
# present. `hash`/`normalization` capture the destination's expectations.
# Every `attribute` URI is verified against the live catalog via the
# narrative-common find-attribute skill — never typed from memory. An
# attribute that doesn't exist yet is a blocker, not a TODO.
identifier_groups:
  - name: email
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/sha256_hashed_email"
    ref_kind: attribute_value
    hash: sha256
    normalization: [lowercase, trim]
  - name: mobile_id
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/mobile_id_unique_identifier"
    ref_kind: attribute_typed_value
    hash: none
    normalization: [lowercase]
  - name: narrative_id
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/narrative_id"
    ref_kind: attribute_context_value
    hash: none
    normalization: []
# Identifiers that work on comparable platforms but this one rejects.
# Load-bearing — prevents a wrong mapping downstream.
identifiers_not_accepted:
  - ip_address

# ── Destination data model ──────────────────────────────────
# What a delivered record becomes on the destination, and where it
# lands. Generalizes across destination flavors: ad-platform audiences,
# email lists, CRM objects, datasets.
destination:
  record_becomes: audience_member   # audience_member | list_member | segment_member
                                    # | crm_contact | dataset_row | event | file_row
  container: custom_audience        # the vendor object records land in (custom
                                    # audience, list, segment, event set, dataset, bucket)
  container_provisioning: either    # connector_creates | customer_creates | either
  match_key: "sha256(identifier)"   # how the destination matches/dedupes delivered

  associations: []                  # secondary vendor objects a record links to
                                    # (e.g. a CRM contact's list memberships)

# ── Quick settings ──────────────────────────────────────────
# One entry per QuickSettingsType the connector exposes. `type` is the
# JSON discriminator ("<platform>_<kind>_quick_settings"); fields drive
# both the Scala codecs and the app-ui form.
quick_settings:
  - type: dv360_audience_quick_settings
    parser: Dv360AudienceParser
    fields:
      - { name: advertiser_id, type: string, required: true,  purpose: "Target advertiser" }
      - { name: membership_ttl_days, type: integer, required: false, purpose: "Audience TTL" }

# ── Partner delivery API ────────────────────────────────────
partner_api:
  endpoints:
    - { method: POST, path: "/v3/customers/{id}/audiences:mutate", purpose: "membership upsert" }
  batch_limit: 500000           # rows or bytes per call/file

  directions:                   # every direction data flows for this connector
    - outbound_membership       # outbound record/membership delivery
    # - conversion_events       # conversion / event ingestion (CAPI-style)
    # - opt_out                 # suppression / removal delivery
    # - measurement_ingestion   # inbound measurement feed (fills `measurement:`)
  path: arrow                   # arrow (default for new connectors) | json (legacy)
  update_model: add_then_remove # native_replace | add_then_remove | swap_and_promote | ttl_forced | upsert
  ttl: null                     # membership TTL / expiry if the destination enforces one
  optout_handling: "remove membership on suppression list match"

# ── Measurement ingestion (present only for measurement/combined) ──
measurement:
  partition_layout: hive        # hive (dt=yyyyMMdd/) | date_path (YYYY/MM/DD/HH/)
  inbox_prefix: "s3://.../<slug>/inbox/"

# ── Open questions ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Real unknowns awaiting an answer — never guessed values. A question
# whose answer blocks a downstream skill is a preflight no-go.
open_questions:
  - question: "Exact per-day request quota?"
    owner: partner              # partner | internal | customer
    status: "asked 2026-07-20; awaiting reply"

# ── Build & deploy targets ──────────────────────────────────
stages: [dev, prod]
modules_omitted: []            # of api|services|stores|worker|executor|poller|infra —
                               # rare; empty means the standard full module set
narrative_db_path: "~/projects/narrative-db"   # prompted; not a sibling checkout by default
```

Fields not yet known carry the literal `TODO` (or `null` where optional)
and are surfaced by `/preflight-connector` before any code is generated.
