# Implement Partner Client

> **Status: stub — implementation pending.** Contract only. Draws on the
> `<Slug>ApiClient` patterns in the reference connectors (magnite,
> snapchat) and the client half of `add-connector-oauth`.

## Purpose

Build the typed client that talks to the destination platform: endpoint
methods, auth-header wiring (static credentials or the OAuth token from
`/add-connector-oauth`), request/response models, pagination, and — most
load-bearing — rate-limit-aware retry/backoff and error mapping so the
executor can deliver reliably.

Phase: **service**.

## Inputs (from connector-spec.yaml `partner_api`)

- `endpoints[]` (method + path + purpose).
- `rate_limits[]` (per-second / per-minute / per-day) → backoff + throttle
  policy.
- `batch_limit`, `failure_semantics` (whole-batch vs row-level) → error
  handling and partial-failure behavior.
- `auth.model` → how requests are authenticated.

## Outputs

- `<Slug>ApiClient` with endpoint methods, request/response models,
  pagination, retry/backoff, and error mapping.

## Human gates

- Local code — no live partner API calls during implementation. Any
  smoke-test call against the real partner is confirmed first and kept out
  of the default path.

## Composition contract

## The `connector-spec.yaml` composition contract

Every skill in `narrative-connector-dev` reads from — and writes back
to — a single machine-readable artifact: **`connector-spec.yaml`**. It
is the shared state that lets the phases compose. `/spec-connector`
authors it, `/preflight-connector` validates and enriches it, and every
downstream skill treats it as the source of truth for slug names, auth,
identifiers, quick settings, and delivery semantics. Nothing is passed
skill-to-skill except this file.

The spec lives next to the connector work, not in this marketplace repo.
The conventional location is
`~/.narrative/projects/<slug>/connector-spec/connector-spec.yaml` (the
same tree `/spec-connector` writes its prose `spec.md` and research notes
into). A skill that can't find it asks for the path; it never guesses
field values.

### Contract rules

- **Read before you write.** Every skill loads the spec first and treats
  its fields as authoritative. If a field a skill needs is missing or
  marked `TODO`, the skill stops and asks — it does not invent slugs,
  app ids, endpoints, rate limits, or Rosetta attribute URIs. (The
  "DO NOT GUESS" rule from `/spec-connector` holds for the whole plugin.)
- **Blocking is skill-scoped.** An `open_questions` entry blocks only
  the skills its `blocks` list names. Before doing anything else, a
  skill checks the list: if any unanswered entry names it, it stops and
  says which questions block it; entries scoped to other skills are
  reported as context, never treated as a reason to stop or to hedge.
  A skill whose own required fields carry real values runs, whatever
  the overall preflight verdict says — the verdict summarizes the
  per-skill picture, it is not a global gate.
- **Write back what you learn.** A skill that resolves a value —
  `preflight-connector` pinning `app_id`, `add-connector-oauth`
  confirming the token-endpoint shape — writes it back so later phases
  read the resolved value.
- **Additive, reviewable edits.** Spec edits are proposed to the human
  and applied on approval, same as any other file change.

### Schema

```yaml

schema_version: 1

# ── Identity ────────────────────────────────────────────────
slug: google-dv360            # lowercase, dashes ok. Drives directory names,

destination_type: audience    # audience | conversion_api | measurement | combined.
                              # `audience` means any outbound record/membership
                              # delivery — ad audiences, email list members, CRM
                              # contacts, dataset rows. Ad platforms are one
                              # flavor, not the frame.

# ── Auth model ──────────────────────────────────────────────
auth:
  model: oauth2               # oauth2 | static_credentials | jwt | sftp_key | partner_id_header
  # Present only when model: oauth2. Drives /add-connector-oauth.
  oauth:
    authorize_url: "https://.../oauth2/authorize"

    scope_encoding: text          # text[] | integer[] — pg column type for scopes
    # Which fields the token endpoint returns → decides token-table columns.
    token_response:

      refresh_token: true
      expires_in: true
  # Present only when model is NOT oauth2 (static_credentials | jwt |
  # sftp_key | partner_id_header). Says what the customer supplies, how it
  # is presented on the wire, and what the profile row stores — the
  # static-credential equivalent of the `oauth` block.
  credentials:
    fields:                     # what the customer pastes into the profile form
      - { name: api_key, type: string, secret: true, purpose: "Customer-minted API key" }
    presentation: "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}"   # how it goes on the wire
    required_scopes: []         # vendor-side permissions the credential must carry
    verification_endpoint: null # a cheap call that proves the credential works
    rotation: customer_managed  # customer_managed | narrative_managed | none
  # Credentials WE issue to the PARTNER, for destinations that call us
  # (webhook receivers, postback URLs). The inverse of the blocks above:
  # here Narrative is the server being authenticated to. Omit when the
  # partner never calls us.
  inbound:
    mechanisms: []              # signature_verification | oauth2_client_credentials
                                # | shared_secret | mtls | none
    signature:                  # present when mechanisms includes signature_verification

      signed_payload: null      # e.g. "timestamp + raw request body bytes"
      key_source: null          # how we obtain the partner's public key
    token_endpoint: null        # path WE host when the partner uses client-credentials
  # Which vendor object the profile binds to (advertiser / ad-account / dataset).
  account_binding: advertiser_id

# ── Identifier groups ───────────────────────────────────────
# Each group is an accepted identifier cluster. `attribute` is the
# canonical Rosetta Stone URI; `ref_kind` is the metaschema $ref
# discriminator (attribute_value | attribute_typed_value |
# attribute_context_value | string_value_type). narrative_id is always
# present. `hash`/`normalization` capture the destination's expectations.
# Every `attribute` URI is verified against the live catalog via the
# narrative-common find-attribute skill — never typed from memory. An
# attribute that doesn't exist yet is created at preflight with the
# user's approval, never invented in the spec.
identifier_groups:
  - name: email
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/sha256_hashed_email"
    ref_kind: attribute_value
    hash: sha256
    normalization: [lowercase, trim]
  - name: mobile_id
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/mobile_id_unique_identifier"
    ref_kind: attribute_typed_value
    hash: none
    normalization: [lowercase]
  - name: narrative_id
    attribute: "https://api.narrative.io/attributes/narrative_id"
    ref_kind: attribute_context_value
    hash: none
    normalization: []
# Identifiers that work on comparable platforms but this one rejects.
# Load-bearing — prevents a wrong mapping downstream.
identifiers_not_accepted:
  - ip_address

# ── Destination data model ──────────────────────────────────
# What a delivered record becomes on the destination, and where it
# lands. Generalizes across destination flavors: ad-platform audiences,
# email lists, CRM objects, datasets.
destination:
  record_becomes: audience_member   # audience_member | list_member | segment_member
                                    # | crm_contact | dataset_row | event | file_row
  container: custom_audience        # the vendor object records land in (custom
                                    # audience, list, segment, event set, dataset, bucket)
  container_provisioning: either    # connector_creates | customer_creates | either
  match_key: "sha256(identifier)"   # how the destination matches/dedupes delivered
                                    # records (e.g. md5(lowercase(email)) for
                                    # Mailchimp list members)
  associations: []                  # secondary vendor objects a record links to
                                    # (e.g. a CRM contact's list memberships)

# ── Quick settings ──────────────────────────────────────────
# One entry per quick-settings type the connector exposes. `type` is the
# JSON discriminator ("<platform>_<kind>_quick_settings"); fields drive
# both the connector's codecs and the settings form.
quick_settings:
  - type: dv360_audience_quick_settings
    parser: Dv360AudienceParser
    fields:
      - { name: advertiser_id, type: string, required: true,  purpose: "Target advertiser" }
      - { name: membership_ttl_days, type: integer, required: false, purpose: "Audience TTL" }

# ── Partner delivery API ────────────────────────────────────

                                  # per-record outcomes are only available by polling
                                  # a status endpoint — the delivery response means
                                  # "queued", not "succeeded".
  job_status:                     # required when failure_semantics: async_job
    endpoint: null                # the status endpoint to poll
    terminal_states: []           # which states end the poll

# ── Delivery semantics ──────────────────────────────────────
delivery:
  directions:                   # every direction data flows for this connector
    - outbound_membership       # outbound record/membership delivery

  ttl: null                     # membership TTL / expiry if the destination enforces one
  optout_handling: "remove membership on suppression list match"

# ── Measurement ingestion (present only for measurement/combined) ──
measurement:
  # How the feed reaches us. bucket_inbox: the partner writes files into an
  # object-store inbox we own and a poll loop ingests them (the framework's
  # MeasurementFeedIngestionProcessor). partner_webhook: the partner PUSHES
  # events to an endpoint we expose — a receiver, not a poll loop, and the
  # `partition_layout` / `inbox_prefix` / `partner_access` fields below do
  # not apply. Defaults to bucket_inbox when omitted.

# Where connector code materializes. The rest of the spec says what the

# ── Build & deploy stages ───────────────────────────────────
stages: [dev, prod]

# ── Deployment extension (optional) ─────────────────────────
# Stack-specific paths and tuning the infra, DB, registration, and
# deploy skills read. Values here are the target environment's, not the
# connector's; a scaffold target that doesn't need them omits the block.
# (Today these skills assume Narrative's stack; the values below are its
# defaults.)
deployment:
  migrations_path: "~/projects/db-migrations"   # prompted; may be a separate repo or a monorepo path
  modules_omitted: []          # rare tuning of the template's module set
```

Fields not yet known carry the literal `TODO` (or `null` where optional)
and are surfaced by `/preflight-connector` before any code is generated.
