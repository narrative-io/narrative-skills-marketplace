# narrative-skills-marketplace

An agent skills marketplace. Plugins live under `plugins/`; each
plugin contains one or more skills under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`.
Skills follow the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io); the
`bash setup` installer currently targets Claude Code.

> **Authoring a skill?** [`docs/authoring-skills.md`](docs/authoring-skills.md)
> is the canonical guide — frontmatter contract, description writing,
> phased body structure, progressive disclosure, composition, the
> template / snippet system, and CI checks. The notes below are the
> 60-second tour.

## Commands

```bash
bash setup   # register the marketplace + install every plugin
```

## Naming conventions

Skills follow the **verb-noun** pattern (`/triage-lead`, `/create-deck`).
Single-word names are fine when the verb is unambiguous (`/commit`,
`/qualify`). Skill directory names match the slash command (lowercase,
hyphen-separated).

| Verb | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `write` | Long-form prose (`/write-blog`, `/write-story`) |
| `create` | Structured artifacts (`/create-slide`, `/create-pr`) |
| `triage` | Categorize + prioritize inbound items |
| `review` | Evaluate existing content |
| `start` | Begin a workflow |
| `capture` | Persist an external artifact |
| `find` | Search existing material |
| `prep` | Prepare for a specific event |
| `build` | Assemble multi-artifact output |
| `sweep` | Scheduled hygiene pass |

Never use adjective-noun (`/new-lead`) or noun-noun (`/campaign-brief`).

## SKILL.md format

Every skill file starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  One- or two-sentence description.
  Include trigger phrases: "use when X", "use when Y".
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - Write
  - AskUserQuestion
---
```

- **name** matches the slash command (no leading `/`).
- **allowed-tools** lists every non-MCP tool the skill calls.
  `AskUserQuestion` is required for interactive skills. MCP tools
  declared in `plugin.json` are globally available and do not need to be
  listed.
- The body is a phased, interactive workflow. Number phases sequentially
  (Phase 1, Phase 2, …).

## Skill design principles

1. **Interactive, not reference** — walk the user through decisions; don't
   just display docs.
2. **AI does the grunt work** — research, enrichment, drafting. Humans
   approve.
3. **One question at a time** — never batch multiple `AskUserQuestion`s.
4. **Evidence over assumptions** — never skip to conclusions without data.
5. **Drafts, not actions** — for external-facing output (email, Slack),
   always draft and require explicit approval before sending.
6. **Graceful degradation** — if an MCP tool isn't available, continue
   without it and note manual follow-ups.
7. **DRY via templates** — pull shared boilerplate (company-context
   pinning, harness fallbacks, voice guidelines) out into `snippets/`
   and reference it from a `SKILL.md.tmpl` instead of duplicating prose
   across skills.

## Template system

Skills can be authored as a `SKILL.md.tmpl` with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`
substitutions; `bun run gen:skill-docs` (also invoked by `bash setup`)
renders them to `SKILL.md` in place. Plain `SKILL.md` files with no
template are left untouched.

### Placeholder syntax

```
{{RESOLVER}}                # no-arg resolver
{{RESOLVER:arg1}}           # one arg
{{RESOLVER:arg1:arg2}}      # colon-separated args
```

Resolver names are UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES. Unknown resolvers fail
the render. Snippets that themselves contain `{{...}}` are resolved
transitively (up to 5 passes).

> **Placeholders only resolve through `.tmpl` rendering.** `bun run
> gen:skill-docs` only discovers and renders `*.tmpl` files. A
> `{{SNIPPET:...}}` (or any `{{...}}`) sitting in a plain `.md` that the
> renderer never processes is shipped **verbatim** — it will not
> resolve. So a placeholder is only effective when it lives in a `.tmpl`
> file **or** inside a snippet that gets inlined into one.
>
> Snippet source files are the one deliberate exception, and they must
> stay `.md`: the resolver looks them up as `<name>.md`, so renaming a
> snippet to `.tmpl` makes it un-findable. A snippet may nest
> `{{SNIPPET:...}}` — those resolve only because the snippet is inlined
> into a `.tmpl` SKILL/reference, where the renderer's transitive passes
> pick them up. Never put a `{{...}}` placeholder in a hand-maintained
> `.md` reference (e.g. `references/FOO.md`); make it `references/FOO.md.tmpl`
> instead.

### Built-in resolvers

| Placeholder | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `{{SNIPPET:<name>}}` | Inlines `snippets/<name>.md` (or `plugins/<plugin>/_snippets/<name>.md` if the snippet is plugin-local). |

### Adding a snippet

1. Create `snippets/<name>.md` (repo-shared) or
   `plugins/<plugin>/_snippets/<name>.md` (plugin-local; takes
   precedence). Write the markdown chunk verbatim, no frontmatter.
2. Reference it from a template:

   ```markdown
   ### Phase 2. Pin the company / context

   {{SNIPPET:pin-company-context}}
   ```

3. Run `bun run gen:skill-docs` to regenerate the rendered `SKILL.md`.

### Adding a resolver

For dynamic content (computed bash blocks, programmatic lookups, etc.)
that can't be expressed as a static snippet:

1. Write `scripts/resolvers/<name>.ts` exporting a `ResolverFn`.
2. Register it in `scripts/resolvers/index.ts`.
3. Use `{{YOUR_NAME}}` or `{{YOUR_NAME:arg}}` in any template.

The resolver signature is `(ctx: TemplateContext, args?: string[]) => string`.
`ctx` provides the skill name, template path, and repo root.

### Generated files

Rendered `SKILL.md` files start with an `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED ... -->`
banner immediately after the frontmatter. Edit the `.tmpl`, never the
rendered output. `bun run check:skill-docs` is a `--dry-run` check
suitable for CI.
