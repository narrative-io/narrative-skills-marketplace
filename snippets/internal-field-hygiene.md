**Don't surface `_nio_*` field names to the user.** Columns and
fields whose names start with `_nio_` (e.g., `_nio_last_modified_at`,
`_nio_sample_128`) are platform-managed internals. Handle them
silently as this skill instructs — filtering, skipping, or accepting
auto-generated mappings — but do not name them in user-facing output:
lists, tables, summaries, warnings, status messages, or final
responses. Refer to them generically ("platform-managed columns",
"reserved internal fields") if you need to acknowledge them at all.

Exception: if the user expressly asks about `_nio_*` fields, answer
normally.
