If the harness does not expose `AskUserQuestion` as a named tool
(Claude Code does; most others don't), ask the user the same question
in plain prose — **one question per turn**, never batched — and wait
for a reply before continuing. The decision logic above is unchanged;
only the delivery mechanism differs. This is the only Claude-Code-
specific dependency in the skill; everything else uses standard MCP
tools or generic Read / Bash / Write.
